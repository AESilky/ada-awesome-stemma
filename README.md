> A curated list of awesome Stemma connector resources including Stemma-equipped microcontrollers and breakout boards.

Adafruit Stemma is a collection of solderless digital/analog/power/I2C connection standards based on JST PH 3 and 4 pin connectors. For smaller footprint breakout boards, the JST SH 4 pin connector may be used for I2C connections.

Stemma equipped boards may be compatible with Seed Studio Grove connectors, SparkFun Qwiic connectors or DFRobot Gravity connectors. Cross-compatibility should be checked before interconnecting Stemma/Stemma QT boards with other manufacturer boards, as there could be connector incompatibilities or voltage issues (with Qwiic boards).
